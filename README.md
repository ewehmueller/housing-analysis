# Housing Analysis

**Author**: [Eric Wehmueller](mailto:ericwehmueller@gmail.com)

## Overview

This project is the second project for Flatiron School's bootcamp program in Data Science.  We are being placed into a hypothetical situation as a Data Scientist and hoping to provide value to our business for the scenario we are given.


## Business Problem

I have been hired by a real estate agency that helps homeowners sell homes.  For this project, I am to provide expected/estimated home prices to homeowners based on the logistics of their home.  This can also give insight on how home renovations might increase the estimated value of their homes, and what type of potential renovations are best.

## Project Deliverables

* A GitHub repository
* A Jupyter Notebook
* A non-technical presentation


## Project Summary

After looking at the data and information available to us, I devised these questions that I believed could be answered through analysis.
***
* 1. Relative to the other features, which home features are impacting our model's target (price) the most heavily.
* 2. Based on OLS coefficients, what potential renovations could we recommend home sellers make?

I explore this thoroughly in the kc_housing.ipynb file contained within this repository via python code: regressions and modeling.
